 Last updated: 5:25PM PDT, 5/9/24 (Relavent for Toronto_listings.csv)
~~Webscrape first Toronto listing from remax.ca~~

~~Gather Data from first page~~

~~Gather Data from multiple pages~~

~~Store data~~

~~Each time script is run, make the csv the name of the date ran~~

~~Analyse data~~

Optional:

Would I be able to get an api (like maps) to get a general location of the property, and correlate that if the closer it is to downtown, the more expensive it is?
#UPDATE: Tried, apis do not like my multiple request calls. Could work if I use Google Maps however I am scared I might get charged money trying. :(
